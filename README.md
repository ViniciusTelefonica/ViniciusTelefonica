Hi! I'm Vinícius de Paula, jr telecom analist for Vivo, a Telefónica's group.

At the moment I'm acting as the devops os my area, automating tasks and processes that have been being (for really long time) manual.
Most of the repos may be private because of sensible data I need to keep safe, but should they be cool to share, I'll make them public.
